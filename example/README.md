# Demo
Examples of using File System Access API with Dart.

See main page (About tab) with a description of the features shown in this demo.

Be aware that this demo may contain bugs. You are the only responsible for its usage. You should only try the Tree 
Viewer tab with a dummy directory, with contents you don't care.

# Usage
To view the examples, run the following command from the root directory of this project â€“ the directory containing 
`pubspec.yaml`:
```shell
$ dart run webdev serve example:4242 --release
```

Remove `:4242` to start server on default port 8080 or use any other port you wish.

Use option `--release` to try `Web Worker` tab. In debug mode, trying to run with a Web Worker will fail.

You can view it with any compatible browsers (Chrome, Edge and Opera).
